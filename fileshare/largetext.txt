Some ciphers are not so secure. DES, which is widely known to be...brittle, has an interesting property when a certain type of key is used. The effect is that the cipher's encryption and decryption methods become identical - when usually they are the inverse. Usually, encrypting a block twice would be just that, however with a weak key, encrypting it twice simply decrypts the block. There are only a handful of keys that have this property (you can look at them on wikipedia), so avoiding them is ideal, but stuff gets really bad when you need to rely on encrypting another ciphertext block to generate a keystream, say.

OFB Mode
Okay, let's forget DES for a minute and explore OFB mode. The way OFB mode works is the cipher takes a first input (an IV), and encrypts it, then encrypts the ciphertext from that to generate the next block etc. The keystream that is generated is then XOR'd against the plaintext. I'm sure you can see where this is going...

Here is a handy diagram that was stolen from wikipedia
